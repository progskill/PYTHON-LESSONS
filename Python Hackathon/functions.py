# Functions & Fibonacci Sequence
# Write a Python program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term n. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms.



# Your program should:

# Ask the user to input the value of n.
# Create a function that takes n as a parameter and returns a list containing the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
# Print the generated Fibonacci sequence.
